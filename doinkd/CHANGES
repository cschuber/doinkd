Changes to doinkd.

V 0.01
======
1. Change of name to doinkd.

2. Add support for Unixware 7.x.
   Patch supplied by Paul Gampe (paulg@apnic.net).
   Patch also adds startup script (init.d/idled).

3. Modified ps_hack_kill to query full tty name.

4. Added maxuser configuration to allow maximum number of sessions
   to be defined per user / group / tty / file.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Changes to Idled.

V 1.16
======
1. Changed some type-castings to be what they should be, which will
   make some compilers happier.  Also decided to see how many
   obsolete systems are out there by removing the manual definitions
   of some functions, such as malloc() and strcpy(), in favor of
   <stdlib.h> (should be fine) and <string.h> (might cause problems
   on older systems with just <strings.h>).

2. Added a define of seteuid() to setresuid() for HP-UX, which does
   not have seteuid.  Thanks to Richard Allen <ra@rhi.hi.is> for the
   patch.

3. Added some code that will hopefully allow idled to work with XDM,
   at least on some systems.  It relies on the user being connected
   to the ":0" tty.  This can be checked by doing "last" (probably).
   If that is the case when a user is logged in on console, then
   you can define XDM_HACK to use it.  If something else is used
   (say, ":0.0"), then you can change the XDM_DEV define in idled.h
   appropriately.

4. Added the ability to have idled mail a message to users that it
   kills.  Definining MAILMESSAGE in the Makefile and ensuring that
   MAILPATH and MAILMESSAGEFILE are set correctly in idled.h will
   have idled send a message to the users.  You will also need to
   write your message in MAILMESSAGEFILE if you wish to use this
   option, of course.

5. Added an option, -DDISABLE_WARNS to the Makefile which will
   prevent idled from warning users, and just go straight to
   logging them out.  This option may be especially useful for
   Digital Unix 3.2 and perhaps other versions, where warnings
   prevent idled from killing anyone.  This option is a fix in
   this condition.


V 1.15a
=======
1. Mistakenly left in the CHANGES file from v1.15 that I only PLANned
   to add code to make sure "Error in warn" was only printed once (in
   #3), but it was actually implemented, as #11 stated.  I changed it
   in this version to avoid confusion.

2. Made changes to get Idled working properly (hopefully) under
   BSDI BSD/OS 2.  It should hopefully compile cleanly and function
   properly now.  More work is planned to ensure functionality.


V 1.15
======
1. Slight modification to the Makefile to make note of the PS_HACK
   kill method for BSD systems, as the standard kill method seems
   to fail for many users.

2. Changed idled.h to have NAMELEN = UT_NAMESIZE for BSD_OS2 systems,
   and perhaps others.  Thanks to Andre Nurwono <nurwonoa@nicolas.acu.edu>
   for informing me of the problem of NAMELEN needing to be 16 instead
   of 8 for these systems.  Other BSD_OS2 changes include using the
   _PATH_UTMP define so setting the UTMP_PATH in idled.h should be
   unnecessary, and not closing fd 0 (stdin) in daemonize() since
   idled strangely exits in yyparse() if it is closed.

3. Added a timestamp to the "Error in warn" logfile message in warn.c.
   Added in a bit of code to ensure that such errors are only printed
   once, and not every sleep time if the utmp entry is invalid.  This
   will help TODO #8 by making it less annoying when the utmp file
   gets out of touch with reality (by Idled killing someone and their
   utmp entry not getting removed).

4. Fixed a bug where if no idle timeout was specified explicitly for
   a user and no 'timeout default' was set either, then users would
   get logged off immediately for being idle 0 seconds.

5. Addition of FreeBSD system definitions to the Makefile, along
   with a new install (install1a) that strips the executable and
   gzips the man pages.  Also, an include file for FreeBSD was
   added to xlock_check.c.  Thanks to Lars Koeller
   <uphya001@odie.physik2.uni-rostock.de> for the FreeBSD info.

6. 'file' type commands now allow '.' in the filenames.  This brings
   the allowed characters in filenames specified in the config file
   'file' commands to include the following:
        Letters A-Z and a-z
        Numbers 0-9
        Characters '/', '.' and '_'.
    I have no plans at this time to extend this further, simply
    because I feel this to be sufficient.  If you have strong
    desires for more allowed characters, send the requests my way.

7. Added an "Unknown login name" error in the parsing of the
   config file.  If a "login <user>" is specified in the config
   file now and <user> is not valid on that system, idled will
   report the error to the log file.  Note that if the user name
   becomes valid later, that it will automatically be utilized
   (it is stored regardless).

8. All references to HAVE_UTMPX have been changed to UTMPPID,
   since it really refered to whether or not the utmp file
   contained the pid of the login shell.

9. Added in 'from host' killing.  In addition to tty, login,
   group, and file, limits can also be set now according to
   the host that the user is logged in from.  Therefore,
        timeout host dopey 5
   will set the idle timout to 5 minutes for any user logged
   on from dopey.  The name of the host that should be used
   in these commands should be the same as is displayed when
   using 'finger' to see where the person is logged on from.
   The length of the host line, as specified in utmp.h (or
   utmpx.h on some systems), should be the length used in idled.h
   as HOSTLEN, if UT_HOSTSIZE is not defined on your system.
   Note that if the host name that a user is logged on from is
   longer than this, then it is truncated in utmp.h and must
   be likewise trucated in the config file.  "localhost" or
   the truncated version may be used to give commands specific
   to users logged in locally.
   
   To use this feature, you must define UTMPHOST in the Makefile
   and also have a ut_host field in utmp entries.  Some systems
   have the ut_host field only in utmpx, and hence they must also
   define HAVE_UTMPX to use the longer utmp entries.
   
   As I don't know what is needed here for different systems,
   please let me know if I need to add one or both of these
   defines for some systems.

10. Idled now prints its version in the log file when it starts.

11. Added a "check list" to help "Error in warn" messages caused
    by a user getting killed and the system not updating the
    utmp file to indicate the line is no longer in use.  Idled
    now will log the error the first time it sees it for that
    line and will not repeat the error.  As soon as the line is
    put to use again, idled will reset the flag for the line and
    continue normal operations.

12. Added a Copyright notice which will hopefully express my
    opinions on the subject to any who are interested.


V 1.13
======
1. Restructure the machine definitions of the Makefile to localize
   the parameters to each machine type.  Also added defines for
   UnixWare 1.1.4.  Thanks to Michael Hancock <michaelh@cet.co.jp>
   for the UnixWare information.

2. Changed the utmplines subprogram to use the UTMP_FILE define.

3. Changed the uid changing in zap.c so that it should log kills
   correctly again (to fix bug introduced in v1.12).


V 1.12
======
1. Added a new subprogram, compiled and run via 'make utmplines'.
   It outputs the number of lines in your utmp file.  MAXUSERS,
   defined in idled.h, should be greater than this number.

2. Added a new parameter in the configuration file called
   'idlemethod' which allows more dynamic configuration of
   the CONSIDER_OUTPUT define.  With it, the CONSIDER_OUTPUT
   define (which was improperly set up in the Makefile of
   v1.11) has been removed.

3. Apparently, the HP-UX settings in the Makefile work perfectly
   for SGI Indy's, so a note of that was made.

4. Fixed the BSD/OS2 compile problem in warn.c.  Changed the
   defs in the Makefile for BSD/OS2 as well.

5. Added <sys/ioctl.h> to xlock_check.c for SYSV systems.  OSF,
   specifically, needed it.  It was something I was told of a
   while ago and forgot to put in the last couple versions (oops).
   Thanks to Noam Krendel <noam@ouray.cudenver.edu> for informing
   me of the change that I forgot to include until 8 months later!

6. Some clarifications were made in the man pages.

7. Changed the definition of where the utmp file is.  It now looks
   in the system include files before using its own.  Hopefully
   this will be completely system independent.  A couple of comment
   descriptions for DIGITAL Unix were also added in the Makefile.
   Thanks to Thomas Kunkelmann <kunkel@ito.th-darmstadt.de> for the
   DIGITAL Unix information.

8. Fixed a bug where users could sometimes be warned for being idle
   while they are logging in.  Idled now longer checks to see if
   a user is idle if they have not been logged in long enough to be
   idle.

9. Added in the ability in idled.cf to specify users via a filename
   containing a list of login names.  Valid new commands are of this
   sort:

         timeout file students 10
         session file students 60
         refuse file idiots
         exempt file staff multiple

   where "students", "idiots", and "staff" are the names of the files
   containing the list of login names of those users, one per line.
   The first word on the line is used as the login name; any spaces
   before that name are ignored, as is any text beyond that name
   (such that comments, if desired, can be placed at the end of the
   lines).  Blank lines are ignored.
   Suggestion by Ken Brown <ccksb@trentu.ca>.
   NOTE:  Filenames at this point can contain letters A-Z and a-z,
          numbers 0-9, '_', and '/'.  Therefore,
                /usr/local/lib/idled/Session_Users1
          is a valid filename, but '.' and other characters cannot
          be used.  I'll probably change this for the next version.

10. Fixed a bug where setting warntime to 0 because no warn time was
    desired would actually give 'sleep' seconds of warn time.  Idled
    will now kill users without any warning if warntime is <= 0.

11. With the CONSIDER_OUTPUT define (ioidle = TRUE in the code), the
    warning that idled issued the user would cause the terminal to
    no longer be idle, thus preventing idled from ever logging the
    user off.  Idled now only checks output from the terminal if it
    has not yet warned the user of that terminal.

12. Due to observed difficulties on Ultrix, idled now attempts to
    "become" the user before performing the zap.  Since this is a
    sensible way to do it anyway, all systems will do this.  Please
    let me know if problems arise from this (for whatever reason).


V 1.11
======
1. Changed the "logfile()" call in the num_uids() procedure
   to debug(), which it should have been.  Sorry about the
   messy addition to the log files.

2. Changes to the Makefile to accomodate HP-UX better.
   Thanks to Don Comstock <dlco@hposc003.atl.hp.com>.

3. Notes in idled.h and INSTALL to indicate how to set
   the mouse name correctly for some unices running on
   an IBM compatible, such as Solaris x86.

4. Idled used to wait until the first sleep time has passed
   before starting idle checks.  It now checks all tty's
   upon startup as well.

5. Changed OSF/1 V3 from install1 to install3.

6. Added an option to have idled determine idleness not only
   by input from the user, but also by output from programs
   in that terminal.  This, for example, would prevent a
   terminal with 'top' displaying system information in it,
   or 'ftp' displaying hash marks during a long download
   from being considered idle.  The CONSIDER_OUTPUT define
   in the Makefile determines which is used (and defaults
   to input-only).

7. Some additions to xlock_check and the Makefile have been
   made to try to get idled to work completely under
   BSD/OS2.  The changes are not yet complete.


V 1.10
======
1. Minor changes to the INSTALL file.

2. Changes to the Makefile, including defs for Ultrix 4.4.

3. Changed the ioctl() calls in zap.c for the non UTMPPID
   method to use tcgetattr() and tcsetattr().  Hopefully that
   will remove system dependencies.

   Also traded in the TCXONC and TIOCSTART ioctl requests
   with a tcflow() call for the same reason, both in zap.c
   and warn.c.

4. Added the cfsetospeed() call in zap.c to eliminate the
   slightly more ambiguous c_cflag = 0, set setting the
   baud rate to 0 is all I really wanted from it anyway.

5. Added a new terminal killing method for systems without
   shell pid's in the utmp file.  To go with it, there is
   now a BAD_PGRP define for such systems that unfortunately
   do not have a useful tcgetpgrp() function that will grab
   the pid of the controlling shell for the tty.  Ultrix
   has a good one, so idled uses this new method.  Is Ultrix
   the only one (such as an ULTRIX define would be better)?

6. Reformatting of procedural comments to make them more
   visible.

7. Changed <termio.h> and <fcntl.h> to be in default include
   directories instead of <sys/*>.

8. Removed all system includes from the dependency lines in
   the Makefile for the various .o's, including the old
   obsolete includes which were no longer used and should
   have been removed long ago.  With it, the <setjmp.h>
   include was moved from idled.h to warn.c, which was the
   only place using it.  Also removed "y.tab.h" from warn.c
   and idled.c, which didn't need it.

   Hopefully this will take care of any dependency differences
   between systems.  Hence, the Makefile.linux is no longer
   included in the distribution.  Hopefully the Linux defines
   at the top of the normal Makefile will be sufficient.

9. Removed -DPROC_SEARCH_1 from the DEFS line for Linux in
   the Makefile.  On slackware, at least, there is no kvm
   stuff, which is required by PROC_SEARCH_1.  I put it in
   without confirming it in idled-1.06beta.

10. Minor man page changes.  Updates to them for the new additions.

11. Rewrote the MULTIPLE Timeouts such that it will allow users
    to have more than one login if the situation is appropriate.
    Now the behavior of multiple logouts is configurable via
    the new "multiples #" command in the configuration file.
    If the # is something like 3, then each user would get to
    keep 3 ttys if the multiple threshold has been reached.
    If the # is -1, then it will allow floor(X/(num users))
    tty's for each user, where X is the threshold limit for
    multiple.

12. Redefined the "conswins" command.  It now is of the form:
        conswins idle <option>
        conswins session <option>
        conswins multiple <option>
    where <option> = normal, off, <number>.  Normal specifies
    that the normal idle, session, or multiple behavior should
    be in place for windows owned by the user on console.  Off
    says that the respective checking should be off for those
    windows.  A Number specifies the time allowed for idle
    and session, or the number of multiple logins allowed.

    NOTE:  Due to this change, if you had "conswins" defined
           in your idled.cf file, you MUST redefine the
           command for idled to properly initialize!!!
           The appropriate change for identical action is
                OLD LINE:       conswins <#>
                NEW LINE:       conswins idle <#>

13. Improved documentation in the Makefile about whether to
    choose install1 or install3 on Solaris 2.x.  Suggestion
    by Peter Turk <p.turk@cxwms.ac.uk>.

14. Added a default option to session limit commands.  It is
    now possible to define a default for anyone who does not
    have a session limit time specified through a group, tty,
    or login command.  A 60 minute default limit would be
    specified like this:
        session default 60
    Thanks to Lincoln Chang <CHANG@svlv03.scs.philips.com>
    for pointing out this missing capability.

15. Defines added to the Makefile for BSDI.  Changes to warn.c
    and xlock_check.c to accomodate.

16. Added in an optional 'ps' hack for systems without UTMPPID.
    The hack calls ps to get pid's for processes on the tty to kill,
    and kills each of the processes.  Defining PS_HACK will use this
    hack.  Thanks to Scott Gifford <swgsh@genesee.freenet.org> for
    the original hack.

17. Changed the session timeouts so that there is now the ability to
    refuse a user who was warned/logged-out from a session limit
    from logging in again until a specified time has elapsed.  The
    time is specified in the config file as
        session refuse <minutes>
    to refuse the users from being logged in for <minutes> after being
    warned/logged-out.  Default is no refuse time.

18. Redefined the #ifdef sequence for yyrestart().  It is now assumed
    that all systems except Linux do not have it.  If a system does,
    defining HAVE_YYRESTART in the Makefile will fix the multiple
    define.  Not all Linux's have the yyrestart() either, though.

19. Created the Idled Homepage for the most up-to-date information on
    idled.  The url is http://www.cs.hope.edu/~crider/idled/
    These pages are a test base to see if users have interest in such
    pages.


V 1.07
======
1. Patches from Noam Krendel <noam@ouray.cudenver.edu>:
        Changed PRNODEV in xlock_check.c to NODEV, which is hopefully
                more common.
        Made idled exit after printing version information when given
                the -V switch.
        Corrected my typo in idled.c to say "exiting" instead of
                "exititing."

2. Patches from Thomas Schenk <tschenk@risc.austin.ibm.com>:
        Some Makefile changes.
        Addition of README.aix file.
        Added an ifndef AIX around NGROUPS in idled.h.
        The new process search method in xlock_check.c didn't
                work, so stuff needed to be ifndef-ed.  In
                preparation for Thomas' third search method,
                I added #ifdef PROC_SEARCH_1 around the second
                method, and added it to Makefile DEFS as
                necessary.

3. Changed the paths to the CONFIG file and LOGFILE to be set in
   the Makefile.  I want to get all configuration options to be
   set in the Makefile, and perhaps a new config.h, if necessary.

4. Simple change to the example idled.cf.  I had the timeout default
   set to 600, which would be 600 minutes, and not the 60 minutes
   I had intended and specified in the comments.

5. Killed the SIGSYS signal trapping in idled.c.  I don't expect that
   it will be needed; I think I just got a little trap happy.
   Same for SIGXCPU.

6. Changed my typo in warn.c to be __linux__ instead of __lunux__.

7. Changed the definition of main() to old-style declarations.
   Also changed the new strtime one in warn.c.

8. Added some <sys/time.h> includes for idled.c and zap.c,
   both for the purpose of time(), and more to please the
   compiler when including <sys/resource.h>.

9. Changed my Solaris 2.3 sigrelse() calls to signal(x, SIG_DFL).

10. I finally finished my port to SunOS 4.x (and hopefully other
    BSD type systems).  It has been tested on SunOS 4.x and does
    work.  For a reason unknown to me, the same method has no
    effect on Solaris 2.x.  This method currently uses SIGQUIT
    instead of SIGKILL.  Which is better?

11. Some updates to the man pages.  The two man pages are now
    generated by doing 'make', or with 'make man'.  It simply
    creates the real man pages with the correct path to the
    configuration file, compliments of sed.

12. Removed the include of <sys/wait.h> in zap.c.  I have no clue
    why it was there.

13. HP-UX patches to zap.c and idled.h, and updates in the Makefile
    from Richard Allen <ra@rhi.hi.is>.

14. Added another 'install' setup to the makefile, install3.

15. Added an INSTALL file to the distribution.  All comments and
    suggestions regarding improvement of this file would be
    gratefully accepted.


V 1.05
======
1. My appologies for not specifying in the original README that idled had
   only been written and tested on Solaris 2.x.  The TODO file specified
   that I planned to get it working on SunOS 4.1.x, and the Makefile
   suggested that it wouldn't work under BSD, but it should have been
   more openly announced and explained where it would work.

2. Patches for HP-UX from Richard Allen <ra@os.is>:
        Change #else NAME and #endif NAME type things to #else /* NAME */.
        Check to see if NGROUPS is already defined.  Don't redefine it if
                is.
        Some #ifdef __hpux lines for includes needed for HP-UX
        Changed "TIOCSTART" in zap.c to "TCIOSTART".  I think it is more
                common?
        Changed the HAVE_PROC_FS define to be in the Makefile, instead of
                idled.h.
        Changes to xlock_check.c to have it compile if HAVE_PROC_FS is
                not defined.

3. Ifndef-ed NGROUPS.

4. Patches for Linux from Jan Niehusmann <jan@gondor.gun.de>:
        Added a yyrestart() call after the yyparse.  Linux didn't reset
                properly otherwise.  Wrote a dummy yyrestart() for systems
                which don't have one in the libraries.
        Added a linux patch to warn.c instead of termf->_ptr = termf->_base,
                which is not portable at all.  Is there a way to make it so?
        Added some linux ioctl calls, since it needs some different defines.
        Tossed in some linux headers.
        Created a linux Makefile.

5. Changed function declarations in xlock_check.c to old style declaration.
   Yuck!  I hate the old style, but anything will compile it, apparently,
   and not all will do new style (why???).

6. Changes to allow killing of users without any warnings, mainly to allow
   killing a user who is not in X, which otherwise can lock up idled
   (on Solaris 2.x, at least) if it tries to warn.
   Logouts on an X Terminal should now work when the user is not in
   X-Windows.  (Tested o.k. on Solaris 2.x.)

7. Added the BSD code to xlock_check.c so that it should function on
   BSD systems properly.

8. Changed the session timeouts so that when it warns you that you
   will have X many minutes/seconds, you will have that time.  The
   old method had the potential of logging you off much earlier
   than it warned (ie. 1 second) depending on how long it slept
   after it warned.  The new version also uses the warn specification
   from the configuration file, like idle timeouts do.

9. Added an alarm 0 before the sleep() call in warn.c, so that it
   could sleep for 5 seconds, like I wanted.  Patch information
   from Chris Jackman <aj@sdiv.cray.com>.

10. Changed warn.c to not print warning messages to the users when
    idled is compiled in debug mode.

11. Changed the console idle checking in idled.c to look only at the
    last access time when checking CONSOLE_NAME for the console user
    not in X.  Seemed more accurate to me to check for idle time.

12. Changed the addlist() call in parse.y for refuse_cmd to also have
    num as a parameter.  list.c uses it for find() for groups.
    Patch by Chris Jackman <aj@sdiv.cray.com>.

13. Added some signal catching so that idled can log fatal errors
    (such as SEGV and BUS) before attempting to dump core and die.

14. idled.c was doing two forks for daemonizing.  That was a little
    silly.  It only does one now.

15. Patches by Thomas Schenk <tschenk@risc.austin.ibm.com> to have
    idled compile under AIX.

16. Added some error checking in case idled is trying to keep track
    of more users than was allotted with 'maxusers' in idled.h.


V 1.00
======
Original Release.
