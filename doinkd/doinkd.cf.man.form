.TH DOINKD.CF 5 "May 30, 2006"
.SH NAME
CONFIGPATH \- doinkd configuration file format

.\"*****************************************************************
.SH DESCRIPTION
.IR doinkd,
the login monitor daemon, decides how it should act based on the file
doinkd.cf.
This file consists of a series of specifications which each
describe an aspect of doinkd's actions.  There are ten types of commands: 
.IP 1.
.B Exemption  
commands
specify people that are exempt from doinkd's actions.
.IP 2.
.B Session
commands specify people who are restricted in the length of time
they may remain logged in.
.IP 3.
.B Timeout
defines how long a terminal must be idle before it is logged out.
.IP 4.
.B Refuse
commands specify people to immediately log off when they are found.
.IP 5.
.B Sleep
sets the number of minutes doinkd should sleep between checks. 
.IP 6.
.B Wait
sets the number of seconds doinkd should give to an idle tty after it
warns before it logs it out.
.IP 7.
.B Conswins
specifies how to handle tty's owned by the user logged in on console.
It can define special handling for idle logouts, session limits, and
multiple logins.
.IP 8.
.B Idlemethod
determines if users are considered idle by input only, or by output
as well.
.IP 9.
.B Threshold
sets the threshold number of users who must be logged in before multiple
login or session limit controls take effect.
.IP 10.
.B Multiples
specifies the behavior of multiple login logouts to control how many
multiple logins each user is allowed to keep.
.IP 11.
.B Maxuser
sets the number of sessions per userid, group, tty or file allowedi.
.PP
Lines beginning with a hash (#) in column one are comments.
Other lines may be indented for readability.

.SH Exemptions
.PP
Exemptions have the form:
.IP
.B exempt
.I who
.I from
.PP
where
.I who
must be one of:
.IP
.B login
.I username
.IP
.B host
.I hostname
.IP
.B group
.I groupname
.IP
.B tty
.I ttyname
.IP
.B file
.I filename
.PP
where
.I Username
must be a valid login name as in /etc/passwd.
.I Hostname
must be identical to the name as displayed by 'finger' when someone
is logged in from that host and truncated to the length of the
ut_host field in utmp.h, if necessary.  "localhost" or the
truncated version (if necessary) allows for specific commands just
for users logged in locally.
.I Groupname
must be a valid group name as in /etc/group.
.I Ttyname
is a terminal name as in the
.B utmp
file (e.g., \*(lqtty\fIXX\fP\*(rq).
.I Filename
is either a filename/path relative to the working directory
doinkd was started from, or is a complete path/filename of a
file listing usernames.  See the
.B Specifying Users Via a File
section below for more information.
.PP
and
.I from 
must be one of:
.IP
.B multiple
.IP
.B idle
.IP
.B session
.IP
.B maxuser
.IP
.B all
.PP
which specify that
.I who
is exempt from being logged off for maintaining multiple logins,
remaining idle longer than the idle timeout period, exceeding a login
session limit, or all three, respectively.

.\"*****************************************************************
.SH Session
.PP
Session commands take the form:
.IP
.B session
.B refuse
.I minutes
.IP
.B session
.B default
.I minutes
.IP
.B session
.I who
.I minutes
.PP
where
.I who
is the same as above and
.I minutes
is a decimal number.
The command indicates the length of time a user may be logged in for
before they must terminate their
.IR session . 
Warnings and logouts will be issued if the
.I session
limit is exceeded.
The
.B default
command specifies the session limit time that should apply to
users that do not have a session limit assigned to them by
some other
.B session
command in the
.I doinkd.cf
file applying to
.BR group ,
.BR login ,
or
.BR tty .
.PP
The
.B refuse
command specifies number of minutes to refuse logins to a user who has
been warned or logged out from a session limit.  Therfore, if the
refuse time is set to 5 minutes, users who are warned or actually
logged out due to a session limit must wait 5 minutes to log back
in, otherwise their tty will be killed as soon as doinkd awakens.
.PP
Session limits are especially useful for modem lines to prevent
users from tying up the line for too long.

.\"*****************************************************************
.SH Timeout 
.PP
Timeouts are of the form:
.IP
.B timeout
.I who
.I minutes
.PP
where
.I who
is the same as above, but can also be
.I default
and 
.I minutes 
is a decimal number.
This command indicates that
.I who
will be logged off after remaining idle for
.I minutes
minutes.  The default idle timeout affects
anyone not otherwise exempted from timeouts or mentioned
in an explicit timeout rule.
.I doinkd
determines idleness to be the length of time from the
last keypress by the user (ie. data throughput alone
is still considered idle).  For X-Windows, both mouse
movements and keypresses determine idle time.

.\"*****************************************************************
.SH Refuse
.PP
Refuse commands take the form:
.IP
.B refuse
.I who
.PP
where
.I who
is the same as above. 
.I minutes
As soon as doinkd spots a user matching a refuse statement, it will
tell the user that the session will be terminated, and will actually
do so approximately 5 seconds later.

.\"*****************************************************************
.SH Sleep
.PP
Sleep commands are of the form:
.IP
.B sleep
.I seconds
.PP
and specify that doinkd will sleep 
.I seconds
seconds between its checks.
If there is more than one sleep specification, only the last one is used.

.\"*****************************************************************
.SH Warn
.PP
Warn commands are of the form:
.IP
.B warn
.I seconds
.PP
and specify that doinkd will sleep 
.I seconds
seconds between warnings and logouts.
If there is more than one warn specification, only the last one is used.

.\"*****************************************************************
.SH Conswins -- Console Windows Handling
.PP
Conswins commands are of the form:
.IP
.B conswins idle
.I option
.IP
.B conswins session
.I option
.IP
.B conswins multiple
.I option

.PP
where
.I option
is one of:
.IP
.I number
.IP
.B normal
.IP
.B off
.PP
The
.I number
specifies the number of minutes allowed for tty's owned by the user
on console for
.B idle
timeouts or
.B session
limits.
For
.BR multiple,
it specifies the
.I number
of multiple logins that should be allowed for the user on console.
These numbers
.I will overide
what the 
.BR timeout ,
.BR session ,
and
.BR multiples
settings would otherwise specify for the user.
.I normal
specifies to use the default timeout, session limits, and number of
multiple logins for the user on console.
.I off
instructs
.B doinkd
to not log off any tty's owned by the user on console, despite how
long they have been idle, how long the tty's have been in session,
or how many tty's are in use (for idle, session, and multiple,
respectively).

.\"*****************************************************************
.SH Idlemethod 
.PP
The idlemethod command is of the form:
.IP
.B idlemethod userinput
.PP
or
.IP
.B idlemethod inputoutput
.PP
When set to
.IR userinput,
doinkd requires that the user interact with (ie. type into) the tty
to be considered not idle.  If a user, then, has not typed anything
recently, that user will be considered idle despite whether or
not the terminal is busy and perhaps displaying output of a running
program.
.PP
When set to
.IR inputoutput,
doinkd will only consider a user idle if there has been no input
.B or
output to the tty recently.  If any program is writing output to
the tty, then, that tty is not idle.  Note that with this setting,
a tty
.B is
still idle if a program is running without user interaction and is
.B not
displaying output to the tty.
.PP
If this option is unspecified, it defaults to
.IR userinput.

.\"*****************************************************************
.SH Thresholds
.PP
Threshold commands are of the form:
.IP
.B threshold 
.I type
.I number 
.PP
where
.I type
must be one of:
.IP
.I multiple
.IP
.I session
.PP
For the
.I threshold multiple
command, the 
.I number
specifies the minimum number of tty's that must be in use before
doinkd begins to limit the users on how many tty's they may have.
For example, if the threshold is set to 10, and 3 users are
logged on 5 times each (each have 5 tty's), then since 3*5=15 and
15 >= 10, doinkd will limit how many tty's they may have.  If the
.B multiples
command (see below) specifies that users get 3 sessions during
this period, then each of the users would have to get rid of two
of their tty's, or doinkd would kill 2 for them.
.PP
For the
.I threshold session
command, the
.I number
specifies the minimum number of tty's that must be in use before
doinkd begins to limit the length of time users may remain logged
on.  If there are at least that many tty's in use, then doinkd will
perform warnings and kill tty's that have been logged in as long
as or beyond their maximum allowed time (specified in a
.B session
command).
.PP
If a
.I threshold
is not set, then no checking will be done.
.PP
.B Multiple
login logouts restrict each user to a number of logins based
on the
.I multiples
setting.  See
.B Multiples
for more information.

.\"*****************************************************************
.SH Multiples
.PP
The multiples command is of the form:
.IP
.B maxuser 
.I type
.I name 
.I number 
.PP
where
.I type
should be the type of
.PP
If the
.I number
is -1, then the number of logins each user is allowed to have
is based on how many different users are currently logged in.
It is figured as the floor of (multiple threshold)/(num users).
So, if the threshold is 10 and there are 2 different users on,
each user would be allowed to keep 5 logins.
If the threshold is 10 and there are 3 different users on,
then each user would be allowed to keep 3 logins.
.PP
If the
.I number
is greater than 0, then it specifies the number
of logins each user will be allowed to keep, despite the total
number of tty's in use.
.PP
doinkd guarantees that each user will be allowed to keep at least
one tty.
.PP
The method in which doinkd chooses which tty's to keep is based
on login time.  The tty's which were started first will be kept,
with the later ones being warned and killed.

.\"*****************************************************************
.SH Maxuser
.PP
The maxuser command is of the form:
.IP
.B multiples 
.I who 
.I number 
.PP
where
.I who
is the same as above.
.PP
.I number
is the number of sessions allowed.
.PP
The method in which doinkd chooses which tty's to keep is based
on login time.  The tty's which were started first will be kept,
with the later ones being warned and killed.

.\"*****************************************************************
.SH Specifying Users Via a File
.PP
As is indicated above, each of the
.B timeout, session, refuse,
and
.B exempt
commands can specify users via a
.B file
statement.  Therefore, such lines would look like these:
.PP
.PD
      timeout file
.B <filename>
<minutes>
      session file
.B <filename>
<minutes>
      refuse file
.B <filename>
      exempt file
.B <filename>
<exempt_type>
.PP
The
.B <filename>
should be either a filename/path relative to the working directory
from which doinkd was started, or a complete path to a user file
(such as /usr/local/lib/users).
.PP
The format of the file is simply one login name per line.  Initial
spaces on a line is ignored.  Any text beyond the first word on the
line is also ignored (so comments, if desired, can be placed at the
end of the lines).  Blank lines are ignored.
.PP
Filenames can contain letters A-Z and a-z, numbers 0-9, '_', '.',
and '/'.  Therefore,

       /usr/local/lib/doinkd/Session_Users1.list
.PP
is a valid filename.  Any other character than those mentioned
above are not allowed in the filenames.

.SH EXAMPLE
.PP
A sample doinkd configuration file follows (look in the doinkd
distribution package for
.BR doinkd.cf ,
an example that shows all commands):
.br
.nf

   #
   # sleep 2 minutes between checks (specified in seconds)
   #
       sleep 120
   #
   # Give 5 minutes between warning and logout (in seconds)
   #
       warn 300
   #
   # Set conswins to off, so that idle, multiple, and session
   # logouts will be disabled for tty's owned by the user
   # logged in on console.
   #
       conswins idle off
       conswins multiple off
       conswins session off
   #
   # 30 users must be logged on before
   # multiple login checks will begin
   #
       threshold multiple 30
   #
   # Do proportional multiple login allows, based on the multiple
   # threshold and number of different users on.
   #
       multiples -1
   #
   # We want session limits to apply all the time
   #
       threshold session 1
   #
   # idlemethod set to "userinput" (default) requires that user
   # interact with the tty to be determined not idle.  Set it to
   # "inputoutput" to allow tty output to also consider the tty
   # not idle.
   #
   #        idlemethod inputoutput
   #
   # Set the timeout for console to be 15 (plus warntime)
   # before it will log off anyone on console.

       timeout host dopey 30
   #
   # Students must not remain logged in for longer than 45 minutes
   #
       session group student 45
   #
   # Necessary exemptions to make sure the console doesn't
   # get logged off for session limits or multiple logins and
   # staff members don't get logged off at all.
