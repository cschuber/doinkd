.TH DOINKD 8 "May 30, 2006"
.SH NAME
doinkd \- Idle terminal and multiple login monitor daemon.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B doinkd
[-f
.B config_file
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
.I doinkd
wakes up at regular intervals and scans the system's
.B utmp
file to see
which users are currently logged in, how long they have been idle,
whether they are logged in more than once, etc.
.I doinkd
then warns and logs out users based on a set of rules in its
configuration file.
.I doinkd
is usually started from '/etc/init.d'.
.PP
.I doinkd
uses a configuration file,
.IR doinkd.cf ,
to find out how long a terminal must be unused to be considered
\*(lqidle\*(rq, and which users, groups, terminals, or clusters of
terminals are exempt from being logged out.
.PP
The path of the configuration file, which is compiled in, can be overriden
by using the flag
.B -f
followed by the name of the configuration file to use (and path,
if necessary).
.PP
.I doinkd
was written from a program called
.I Idled,
which gets its name for obvious reasons.  
.I Idled
was written from a program called
.I Untamo,
which gets its name from the Finnish god of sleep and dreams.
.SH FILES
.TP
.B CONFIGPATH
Configuration file which specifies how often doinkd is to wake up, and
exemptions to rules, etc.
There is no need to restart doinkd to change the configuration. 
If changes are made to this file, doinkd will re-read the configuration
rules.
.TP
.B LOGFILEPATH
Log of when doinkd is started, killed, who it logs off and why, and any
errors it encounters.
.SH AVAILABILITY
.PP
The newest version of doinkd is available from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/idled

All comments and suggestions for doinkd would be greatly appreciated
and should be sent to lottc at SpinnakerResorts dot com
.SH DIAGNOSTICS
Various \*(lqcouldn't open ...\*(rq error messages.  Since doinkd
dissacociates itself from the invoking terminal, most of the errors
get put in the log file.

.SH BUGS
If a user logs off and then on again fast enough and manages to get a
different tty, he may be warned about a multiple login.
.PP
It will not warn the person on console about being logged off
if that person is not in X-Windows, since things get really screwy
then (due to some weirdness in the system blocking reading of the
utmp file until a person hits <return> on the console's keyboard--
and that is one <return> for each utmp line!).
.PP
If 
.B doinkd
is started considerably after a user's session limit is up,
it will warn that it is waiting "warn" time before killing
the session, but will actually only wait 10 seconds (which
is adjustable via a line in chk_session() in doinkd.c).  I
left this because it would be somewhat messy to fix it, when
it will probably not have much effect anyway.
